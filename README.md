This is Rython version 0.0.1
============================

This fork (of the friendliest kind, of Python 3.5.1) 
only does one thing differently than Python. 
It always prints out the contents of sys.path at startup.

This is hardcoded to run before any PYTHONSTARTUP script.

```
Rython 0.0.1 (default, Mar 25 2016, 11:13:00) 
[GCC 4.8.4] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

  sys.path:

/usr/local/lib/python35.zip
/home/jmclarty/projects/Rython/Lib
/home/jmclarty/projects/Rython/Lib/plat-linux
/home/jmclarty/projects/Rython/build/lib.linux-x86_64-0.0

```

The purpose of this fork is just to explore an idea.

An idea which I'm 100% sure the current python community would not tolerate due to the likely backwards-compatibility breaks.
